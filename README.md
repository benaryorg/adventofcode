# Advent of Code

This is my code for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).
I largely use it to get at least some green dots on GitHub these days so I'm neither super on time nor very competitive about it.
Thus here's my (probably rather disgusting) code for all this.

# My Code

My code fetches the input directly from upstream (although I feel bad for using the AoC resources for that) and thus requires a session cookie.
That cookie should be passed as an environment variable (`ADVENTOFCODE_SESSION`).

The individual days are to be found in the [releases](https://github.com/benaryorg/adventofcode/releases) aka git tags.

## Issues

Please open an issue if:

- you know a way to get an API token or similar so I can stop using my session cookie
- my querying upstream for the input on every run turns out to use quite the amount of resources and you'd rather have me stop
- you find a bug, I guess?
